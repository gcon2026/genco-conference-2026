# Genco Conference 2026

A futuristic, completely front-end responsive static website for the Genco Conference.

## How to Run

Since this is a set of static HTML, CSS, and JS files, no complex build system or local web server is strictly necessary.

### Easiest Way:
1. Navigate to the `genco-2026` directory.
2. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
3. Click on "Global Access" to enter the main app and navigate around!

### Optional (If you want a local server):
If you have Python installed, you can start a simple server from this directory:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Backdrop Filter)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, simulated validation)
